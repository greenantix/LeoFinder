## ðŸš€ Deploy on Render

Deploying to Render requires special attention to environment variables.

### `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
When adding your Firebase private key to Render's environment variables, paste the entire key as a single line, replacing newlines with `\n`. Render's environment variable editor does not correctly handle multi-line strings.

### `DATABASE_URL`
Ensure that any special characters in your Postgres password are URL-encoded. For example, `@` should be `%40`, and `:` should be `%3A`.

### Environment Variable Conflicts
You can commit a `.env.production` file and load it via `dotenv`. If you do this, you must unset those same variables in Render's dashboard to avoid conflicts. Render's environment variables will override any variables loaded from a `.env` file.
